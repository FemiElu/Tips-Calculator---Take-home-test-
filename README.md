## APPRECIATION
 I appreciate the privilege for the take home test. I humbly hope that this result suits you and in turn leads to my consideration. 

 I apologise for not using styled components as required. My styled components skills are still a bit rough around the edges and I do not want to jeopadize the work. Nevertheless, I believe I know enough about it to get me started if I just do a little practice. Thank you for your understanding.
